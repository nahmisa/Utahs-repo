      <h3>Utah's Opinions on <span>Fennec Foxes</span></h3>
      <pre>
        Fennecs are pretty much the cutest animals ever.  They are like if a corgi and a normal fox had babies.
        <!-- <img src = "image.png"> can we even put images in pre?-->
        Fennecs are also real good at side eye.

        Fennec Stats:
          Fennecs are real small.
          They have big ears as way to keep cool in desert.

      <h4>Scientific Opinions on <span>Fennec Foxes</span></h4>

      <!-- a section that is quoted from another source -->



        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fennec_fox">
        <!-- <blockquote> does not allow for line breaks like pre does and that is sad. I could nest blockquote in pre to get that to work?-->
        The fennec fox or fennec (Vulpes zerda) is a small nocturnal fox found in the Sahara of North Africa. Its most distinctive feature is its unusually large ears, which also serve to dissipate heat. Its name comes from the Arabic word فنك (fanak), which means fox, and the species name zerda comes from the Greek word xeros which means dry, referring to the fox's habitat.
